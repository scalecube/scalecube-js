# Discovery

Discovery is used that publish and discover values in a distributed environment.

## Basic Usage

```javascript
const discoveryConfig = {
  seedAddress: 'defaultEnvironment', // string
  address: 'random-discovery-identifier', // string
  itemsToPublish: [], // Item[]
};
const discovery = createDiscovery(discoveryConfig);
```

After the creation of the discovery, it is possible to subscribe to `discoveredItems$()`
and then to receive information about the other discoveries that join the same environment ('seedAddress')

```javascript
discovery.discoveredItems$().subscribe(console.log); // emits all values from the other discoveries that are joining the same 'seedAddress'
```

After the creation of the discovery, it is possible to remove it by `destroy()`
destroy will complete the stream, remove the discovery's data from the environment
and notify all other discoveries about the change.

```javascript
discovery.destroy().then(console.log); // random-discovery-identifier has been removed from defaultEnvironment
```
