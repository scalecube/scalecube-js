# Scalecube

Microservices library inspired by the java scalecube-services. scalecube provides an abstraction toolkit to provision and consume microservices as such the interaction model is by a service api avoiding tight-coupling between service implementation and technology.

## Project Status

currently we are working on version 0.2.x
and it will be the first version with LTS (meaning the API will be backwards compatible until the major will change).
The SLA is still under debate and will be release as part of 0.2.x
